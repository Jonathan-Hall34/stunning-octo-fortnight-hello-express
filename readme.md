### App Story
The app showcases modern web development with Node.js/Express backend, MongoDB for data persistence, and a responsive frontend using Bootstrap, jQuery, and custom styling. Users can create unlimited Pokemon teams, each containing 6 randomly selected Pokemon with their sprites, names, and types displayed in a card-based interface.
